                <p>The debate club run by the National Ideal School is known as the <b><i>Banasree National Ideal School Debating Club</i></b>.<br>
                    Debate has become an elite art in the twentieth century, following the path of the glorious history of debate.
                    The triumph of youth in the power of reason is all around today. <i>Banasree National Ideal School Debating Club-BNIDSC</i>
                    is committed to inculcate a sense of humanity in the students of National Ideal School by spreading this debate practice
                    among them. On 11th October 2018, <i>Banasree National Ideal School Debating Club</i> was started following the initiative of 
                    some enterprising boys of Banasree campus 1-A of National Ideal School. The club was named "National Ideal Debating Club" at the 
                    time of its inception. Later the name was changed to "Banasree National Ideal School Debating Club". In addition to textbook based education, 
                    <i>BNIDSC</i> is working to make students think outside the textbook and encourage them in co-educational activities.<br>
                    The club was established during the time of the Headmaster Sheikh Farid Ahmed sir. From then
                    various formal debate activities are being organized regularly by this club. Presently the moderator of
                    <b> BNISDC </b> is MD. Afroj Sarker. He is running this club effectively with other teachers and students from
                     the very beginning of his position. <br><br>
                     The aims and objectives of BNISDC are to uplift the students through constructive practice of debate; To develop the 
                     qualities of tolerance, creativity, rational and innovative thinking and tolerance of the students.
