                <p>
                  After the “1st NIDC Intra NIS Debate Competition - 2019”, the Banasree National Ideal School Debating Club appeared with 
                  the “BNISDC Clash of Orators”, which was an online debate competition.<br>
                  The world was at a standstill because of the corona virus. Everyone was staying at home for fear of contracting the 
                  corona virus. While at home, we came up with the "BNISDC Clash of Orators" through the Discord App for Debate Lovers.<br>
                  The money from the registration fee for this tournament was given to help the poor people who became helpless due to the corona
                  virus infection. We were able to help the helpless people through the participation of 32 teams and 96 debaters from different
                  parts of Bangladesh.<br>
                  The tournament was held with 24 teams.
                  Registration was done online. The debaters had a chance to debate 4 rounds.<br><br>
