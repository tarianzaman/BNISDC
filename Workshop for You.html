or unfair set up should be made from the LO speech and nolater).<br>

                the teams will be ranked from first place to fourth place. Eachranking has a point value associated with it. The common
                 point values used are as follows:<br>
                First Place = 3 points<br>

                Third Place = 1 point<br>
                Fourth Place = 0 point <br>
                pointsYour points are added over the course of the tournament. The break is determined bypoint total,
                 and speaker points if some teams have the same point total.
